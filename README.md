# ACO Classification
An algorithm using Ant Colony Optimization for classification

## Installation
The easiest way to install the project is by using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a Python distribution for scientific use. Anaconda is a large and may take a long time to download and install, so alternatively you can use [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), a lightweight version of Anaconda.

After installing Anaconda, `cd` into the project directory and install project environment with:

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml python=3.5
```

This will install a full conda environment named *acoc*. Activate the enviroment by running:

```
$ source activate acoc
```

## Usage
A complete classification example can be found in *main.py* in the root folder.
